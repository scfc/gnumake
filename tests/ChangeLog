	* test_driver.pl (touch): Rewrite this function.  Previously it
	used to use utime() to hard-set the time based on the current
	local clock.  This fails badly on networked filesystems where the
	FS server clock is skewed from the local clock: normally modifying
	a file causes it to get a mod time based on the _server's_ clock.
	Hard-setting it based on the _local_ clock causes gratuitous
	errors and makes the tests unreliable except on local filesystems.
	The new function will simply modify the file, allowing the
	filesystem to set the mod time as it sees fit.

	* scripts/features/parallelism: The second test output could
	change depending on how fast some scripts completed; use "sleep"
	to force the order we want.

	* test_driver.pl (toplevel): A bug in Perl 5.000 to Perl 5.004
	means that "%ENV = ();" doesn't do the right thing.  This worked
	in Perl 4 and was fixed in Perl 5.004_01, but use a loop to delete
	the environment rather than require specific versions.

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Don't use Perl 5 s///
	modifier "s", so the tests will run with Perl 4.
	(set_more_defaults): Set $pure_log to empty if there's no -logfile
	option in PURIFYOPTIONS.
	(setup_for_test): Don't remove any logs unless $pure_log is set.

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Put the SHELL definition in the right
	test makefile.
