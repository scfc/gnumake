	* scripts/features/parallelism: The second test output could
	change depending on how fast some scripts completed; use "sleep"
	to force the order we want.

	* test_driver.pl (toplevel): A bug in Perl 5.000 to Perl 5.004
	means that "%ENV = ();" doesn't do the right thing.  This worked
	in Perl 4 and was fixed in Perl 5.004_01, but use a loop to delete
	the environment rather than require specific versions.

	* run_make_tests.pl (set_more_defaults): Don't use Perl 5 s///
	modifier "s", so the tests will run with Perl 4.
	(set_more_defaults): Set $pure_log to empty if there's no -logfile
	option in PURIFYOPTIONS.
	(setup_for_test): Don't remove any logs unless $pure_log is set.

	* scripts/features/reinvoke: Put the SHELL definition in the right
	test makefile.
